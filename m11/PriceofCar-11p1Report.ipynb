    "# Used Car Price Analysis Final Report\n",
    "### *What Drives the Price of a Used Car?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Used Car Dealerships\n",
    "**Objective:** Identify key drivers of used car prices and build predictive models to fine-tune inventory decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Objective\n",
    "Our goal was to determine **what factors most influence used car prices** and how to use this information to:\n",
    "- Accurately estimate market value\n",
    "- Optimize vehicle purchasing decisions\n",
    "- Identify vehicles with strong resale potential\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Overview\n",
    "We analyzed a dataset with **over 400,000 used car listings** from across the U.S., containing:\n",
    "- Price, Year, Manufacturer, Model\n",
    "- Odometer, Condition, Transmission, Cylinders, Fuel type, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning:\n",
    "- Focused on cars from the last **30 years**\n",
    "- Removed price and odometer outliers\n",
    "- Retained records with realistic and complete data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "We created powerful new features to better explain price variation:\n",
    "- `car_age` = 2025 - year\n",
    "- `miles_per_year` = odometer / car_age\n",
    "- `price_per_mile` and `price_by_age` = value indicators\n",
    "- `manufacturer_tier` = luxury vs. standard\n",
    "- `usage_intensity` = very low to very high usage\n",
    "- `is_high_power` = 6 or 8 cylinders\n",
    "- `price_segment` = bucketed price category\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Modeling Approach\n",
    "We tested 3 regression models:\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** – easy to interpret\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression** – avoids overfitting with regularization\n",
    "- **Random Forest Regression** – non-linear, flexible, accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "- **R²**: How well the model explains price variance\n",
    "- **Adjusted R²**: Corrected for number of features\n",
    "- **MSE**: Mean squared error of predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Performance Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model              | Train R² | Test R² | Test Adj. R² | Test MSE | Notes                                     |\n",
    "|--------------------|----------|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Linear Regression  | 0.917    | 0.917   | 0.914         | 0.061     |  Reliable, interpretable                 |\n",
    "| Ridge Regression   | 0.917    | 0.917   | 0.914         | 0.061     |  Adds regularization                     |\n",
    "| Random Forest      | 1.000    | 0.999   | 0.999         | 0.0001    |  May be overfitting, but highly accurate |\n",

    "## 6. Key Insights for Dealers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors that drive higher used car prices:**\n",
    "-  Newer vehicles (low age)\n",
    "-  Low mileage per year\n",
    "-  Luxury brand (e.g., BMW, Lexus)\n",
    "-  6-8 cylinders (high performance)\n",
    "-  Good condition, clean title, automatic transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red flags that lower price:**\n",
    "-  High odometer for age\n",
    "-  Older cars from low-demand manufacturers\n",
    "-  Manual transmission or salvage title\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  7. Actionable Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus purchasing on **late-model, low-mileage** inventory\n",
    "- Prioritize **luxury or high-demand brands** with clean titles\n",
    "- Avoid overpaying for cars with **high usage intensity**\n",
    "- Use the model to **predict fair price** before acquiring vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  8. Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Deploy Ridge or Random Forest model in pricing system\n",
    "-  Build an internal dashboard for predictions\n",
    "-  Enhance future models with location or seasonal factors\n",
