# 16.1: Finalizing Your Problem Statement 

## Refine your problem statement to include a research question, expected data sources and structure, expected results and techniques.
This is a required assignment and counts toward program completion.

By this point in the program, you will have posed a question to answer in your final capstone submission and met with your Learning Facilitator to refine your question and generate ideas for datasets and techniques. Now it is time to submit the official proposal or problem statement.

On this discussion board, your initial post should contain the following:

 - The research question you intend to answer (in one sentence, if possible)
 - Your expected data source(s) (as either a link to existing data or a sentence describing where you will source the data from)
 - The techniques you expect to use in your analysis
 - The expected results
 - Why this question is important

That last bullet point is the most important. Remember that your final capstone project will be graded not only on the execution of your plan but also on your ability to translate those results into actionable business intelligence that can be acted on by non-AI/ML personnel. Not only will you have to do the number crunching, but you will also have to distill the results into something that the general public can understand. This last bullet point is your opportunity to explain (in non-AI/ML language) why this question is important. What happens if this question is unanswered? What benefit will your analysis bring?
